# GCP Conformance Configs

This config uses the [gcp/conformance](/deployment/modules/gcp/conformance) module to
define a conformance testing environment. At a high level, this environment consists of:
- Spanner DB,
- GCS Bucket,
- CloudRun service running the [GCP-specific conformance binary](/cmd/conformance/gcp).

The config allows identities (e.g. service accounts) to be provided to allow access to
reading from, and writing to, the log.

## Automatic deployment

For the most part, this terragrunt config is automatically used as part of conformance
testing by the [Cloud Build](/deployment/live/gcp/cloudbuild) pipeline, so doesn't generally
need to be manually applied.

## Manual deployment 

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed:

- ['golang'](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- One of:
   + [`terraform`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) or
   + [`opentofu`](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)
- [`terragrunt`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/)

#### Google Cloud tooling

[!CAUTION]
This example creates real Google Cloud resources running in your project. They will almost certainly
cost you real money if left running.  For the purposes of this demo it is strongly recommended that 
you create a new project so that you can easily clean up at the end.

Once you've got a Google Cloud project you want to use, and have configured your local `gcloud`
tool use use it, and authenticated as a principle with sufficient ACLs for the project:

```bash
gcloud config set project {YOUR PROJECT}
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Set environment variables

Set the required environment variables:
```bash
# The ID of the Google Cloud Project you're deploying into
export GOOGLE_PROJECT=$(gcloud config get project)

# This should be a note signer string.
# You can use the generate_keys tool to create a new signer & verifier pair:
#   go run github.com/transparency-dev/serverless-log/cmd/generate_keys@HEAD --key_name="TestTessera" --print
#   set {VALUE} to the entire first line of output, e.g. TESSERA_SIGNER='PRIVATE+KEY+TestTessera+....'
export TESSERA_SIGNER={VALUE}

# This is the name of the artifact registry docker repo to create/use.
export DOCKER_REPO_NAME=tessera-docker

```

Optionally, set the environment variables below to customize the deployment:
```bash
# GCP region to deploy into (defaults to us-central1)
export GOOGLE_REGION={VALUE} 

# This is used as part of resource names, using this variable will allow you to have multiple deployments in a single project.
export TESSERA_BASE_NAME={VALUE} 

# This allows you to specify the email of an existing service account which should be used by Cloud Run.
# By default, the project's default service account will be used.
export TESSERA_CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={VALUE}

# This allows configuration of which users are allowed to read from the GCS bucket containing the t-log tiles.
# To make the bucket public, set this to "allUsers".
export TESSERA_READER={VALUE}

# This allows configuration of which users are allowed to make HTTP requests to the Cloud Run instance, e.g. to add entries to the t-log.
# By default, only the project's default service account is permitted.
export TESSERA_WRITER={VALUE}
```

#### Set up artifact registry

First, create a new artifact registry based Docker repo:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create ${DOCKER_REPO_NAME} \
        --repository-format=docker \
        --location=us-central1 \
        --description="My Tessera docker repo" \
        --immutable-tags
```

Then authorize your local `docker` command to be able to interact with it:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

### Process

#### Build & push docker image

You will need to build and push the image created by the
[the /cmd/conformance/gcp/Dockerfile](/cmd/conformance/gcp/Dockerfile) somewhere.
Google Artifact Registry is one option: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-push-docker-image

Note that it's not currently possible to _build_ the docker image with Google Cloud Build (this is because
building from the root directory but referencing Dockerfile in a subdirectory isn't supported), but you can
configure your local `docker` to get access to Artifact Registry using the gcloud CLI credential helper, and
then build locally and push to Artifact Registry. Details on this can be found in the link above.

```bash
docker build . -f ./cmd/conformance/gcp/Dockerfile --tag us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/${DOCKER_REPO_NAME}/conformance:latest

docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/${DOCKER_REPO_NAME}/conformance:latest

# The docker image:tag for the image you just built.
export TESSERA_CLOUD_RUN_DOCKER_IMAGE=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${GOOGLE_PROJECT}/${DOCKER_REPO_NAME}/conformance:latest

```

#### Terragrunt apply

Finally, apply the config using `terragrunt`:

 1. `cd` to the relevant directory for the environment to deploy/change (e.g. `ci`)
 2. Run `terragrunt apply`

This should create all necessary infrastructure, and spin up a Cloud Run instance with the
docker image you created above.

### Clean up

[!IMPORTANT]
You need to run this step on your project if you want to ensure you don't get charged into perpetuity 
for the resources we've setup.

```bash
gcloud projects delete ${GOOGLE_PROJECT}
```
